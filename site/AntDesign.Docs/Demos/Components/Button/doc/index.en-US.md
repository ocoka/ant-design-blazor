To trigger an operation.

## When To Use

A button means an operation (or a series of operations). Clicking a button will trigger corresponding business logic.

In Ant Design we provide 4 types of button.

- Primary button: indicate the main action, one primary button at most in one section.
- Default button: indicate a series of actions without priority.
- Dashed button: used for adding action commonly.
- Link button: used for external links.

And 4 other properties additionally.

- `danger`: used for actions of risk, like deletion or authorization.
- `ghost`: used in situations with complex background, home pages usually.
- `disabled`: when actions is not available.
- `loading`: add loading spinner in button, avoiding multiple submits too.
